abstract: "Digital libraries are online platforms for organizing, sharing, and providing access to resources. Ideally, they are developed by, with, and for specific user communities. Metadata frameworks, as integral components of digital libraries, should also reflect the needs and serve the interests of those communities. In this paper I report on one aspect of my doctoral research which involved working collaboratively, respectfully, and appropriately with members of the Inuvialuit community in the northwestern part of Canada to explore and articulate a culturally responsive metadata framework for their digital library of cultural resources.
